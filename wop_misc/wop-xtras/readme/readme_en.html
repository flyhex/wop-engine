				<h1>The Menu</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Main Menu</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="Main Menu" src="pictures/menu/main_kl.jpg">
				After the intro movie (interruptable with a mouse click), you will see this starting screen. From here you can
				access all the submenus.
				Once there, [ESC] will get you back.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Multi</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="Multi" src="pictures/menu/server_kl.jpg">
				This will also be very important for all the offline and LAN gamers out there. The cool thing on this menu is
				that you are able to choose more than one map! Just click on the maps you want to play in the sequence you
				wish to play them,
				they will by signed with a number, and the maps will rotate automatically. By the way, if you hover over the
				comic shot,
				you'll see an in-game picture of the map. At the bottom of this screen you can select the game mode.
				This should be done before (!) creating the map sequence.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Select Bots</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="Select Bots" src="pictures/menu/bot_kl.jpg">
				This works like the map selection, just click on the bots you want to play with and they will populate the
				list on the right.
				To remove a bot from the list, just click on his/her name in the list. If you have selected a team game, the
				team of the bot will appear beside its name.
				You can change its team by clicking on it, and you can also select its skill level.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Player</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="Player" src="pictures/menu/player_kl.jpg">
				Main -> Setup -> Player. Here you are able to select the model, skin, name, logo and color of the logo.
				At the top of the screen the models are listed, choose one and click on it. Now look at the right part and
				select a skin for your model.
				The variation of skins depends on the model you have selected.<br>
				To get a better view of the model, you can rotate it. Left click (CTRL on Mac) on the 3D model and hold the
				button. Now move your mouse.
				By using the weapon change key you can also see how the model holds the different weapons.<br>
				On the left side of this menu you should enter your name. The arrows under the logo change the logo. The color
				selection is also for the logo.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Game Options</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="Game Options" src="pictures/menu/options_kl.jpg">
				Main -> Setup -> Options. Besides some graphic details, which you can set here, the crosshair and the HUD
				options are the most important ones.
				To select the crosshair, just click on it to cycle through the different ones available and stop clicking if
				you've chosen your favourite one.
				The HUD selection will be displayed in a cool list. Click on HUD and you'll get a list of all available HUDs.
				Now select the one you want to use and click on it. Done? Good. These changes will be applied immediately.
				If you want to change your crosshair or HUD during a game, you can do so, and after returning to the game
				you'll see your new selections.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>In-game Music Menu</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="In-game Music Menu" src="pictures/menu/musik.jpg">
				This is our in-game jukebox, which is filled up with tracks, all done specifically for World of Padman. You
				can reach this menu using two different ways:
				either by a bound key, or in-game via ESC > Music Menu. On the album cover that appears, you can see all the
				tracks that are available.
				Just click on the one you want to listen to and it will be played. It is also possible to create a play list.
				Just click the tracks you like in the order you want to listen to them. You can switch between albums,
				and creating a play list with tracks from different albums is supported.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>In-game Vote Menu</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="In-game Vote Menu" src="pictures/menu/callvote.jpg">
				You are playing on a server but you want to change the map or game type? In WoP you can call a vote among the
				players from the in-game menu.
				Just click on "Call Vote" and choose the action you want to vote for in the upper area. In the lower area
				you'll get a list of maps.
				After calling a vote you just have to wait and see if the other players agree or not.<br style="clear: both;"/>

				<h1>The Game Modes</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Spray your Color (SyC)</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/misc/teleporter.jpg" alt="Teleporter">

				Spray your Color (SyC) is the main game type in WoP. The goal is to spray your logo on the walls in the spray
				room. But, hey, that would be too easy:<br>
				You have to frag an opponent to get a cartridge, you need to collect this cartridge to spray a logo.
				The maximum number of cartridges you can have at any one time is eight. After you have at least one cartridge,
				you can enter a special teleporter (shown on the left), which will spawn you into a new room: the spray room.
				In here you have only your spray pistol,
				so no fragging in here. ;) In the spray room are two different walls: one for the red team and one for the
				blue team.
				You only get points if you spray your logo on the wall of your team; otherwise you just lose the cartridge(s)
				without scoring.
				This game type is playable as FFA and Team Play. In FFA there is no difference between the walls, just spray
				your logo where you want.
				In FFA you cannot collect your own cartridge but in Team Play you may remove your color cartridge by walking
				over it.
				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				Every logo sprayed gives your team 5 points. In FFA you will score only for yourself ;).If you manage to spray
				five logos without leaving the spray room,
				you'll receive 10 bonus points. For eight logos without leaving you'll gain an additional bonus of 25
				points.
				<h3>Examples</h3>
				3 logos: 3 * 5 points = 15 points<br>
				5 logos: 6 * 5 points = 30 points + 10 points bonus = 40 points<br>
				8 logos: 8 * 5 points = 40 points + 10 points bonus + 25 points bonus = 75 points<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Big Balloon (BB)</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:right;" src="pictures/misc/balloon.jpg" alt="Balloon">
				Big Balloon is nothing more than the good old "Domination" known from the game Unreal Tournament. The only
				difference is, that we use boxes that contain balloons. For all those who don't
				know what "Domination" is about here's a short description:<br>
				In every map you will find three boxes. As soon as you touch a box, a balloon of your team's color will float
				up. To fasten the process of raising the balloon, simply get more players of
				your team aside.
				As long as the balloon is fully up you'll get points! But if the opponent touches the box for more than 3
				seconds,
				your balloon will be destroyed and a new one with the color of the opposing team will come out. Now the
				opposing team gets the points
				if a successful re-capture is made!<br>
				To make it easier to locate the balloons in the maps, we have implanted a special HUD and a "wall-hack", that
				also indicates the color of the balloon, so which team scores at the moment.
				<h3>Scoring</h3>
				For every balloon in your team's color your team will get 1 point every 2 seconds.<br>
				If your team dominates all three balloons, the points are doubled. Every two seconds you'll get two points for
				one balloon so in total you will get 6 points per 2 seconds!<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Capture the Lolly (CtL)</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/misc/lollies.jpg" alt="Lollies">
				The well known and liked gametype "Capture the Flag" has its appearance in the World of Padman, too. Instead
				of flags, the Pad is hunting sweet lollies. This mode is played by two teams,
				each trying to get into the enemy's base to steal the lolly. After taking the lolly, you have to reach your
				own base and get to your lolly to score. If your team's lolly is stolen by the
				enemy, the lolly has to be returned before you can score. Returning the lolly is done by fragging the enemy
				holding the lolly and running over the remaining candy. It will instantly return
				to your base and doesn't have to be carried back. Only teams which work together well will be successful.
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Last Pad Standing (LPS)</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:right;" src="pictures/misc/lpswallhack.jpg" alt="Wallhack">
				LPS is our Last Man Standing game type. Every player has a fixed number of lives and will go into spectator
				mode as soon as all his/her lives are gone.
				At the end of the game there will be only one player still alive. He/she is the winner!
				Oh, you will notice that we have implemented a "wall-hack" so that you can locate all of your opponents fairly
				easily. This was done because of all the campers who like to play
				hide and seek to keep their lives up. Sorry campers, no chance. And to make it a bit more exciting, the
				leading player is marked with a red symbol, so the other players will hunt that player
				for sure. If more than one player is on top of the lives list, they will all be marked with the red icon.
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>InstaPad</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:right;" src="pictures/weapons/injector.jpg" alt="">
				"InstaPad" isn't a standalone game type, it can be additionally activated to every game type in the game from
				the menu. If you play with "InstaPad" activated, all weapons and ammo boxes will
				be removed from the maps and the players will be equiped with unlimmited ammo and a special weapon from the
				beginning - the iNJECTOR. The iNJECTOR has basically the same characteristics as the
				SPLASHER, so it has a low fire rate, but causes high damage - one hit usually crushes the enemy down. This
				weapon is accessorily featured with a special zoom which highlights the enemies.
				Hence "InstaPad" is the perfect addon for fans of sharp shooters and fast gameplay.<br style="clear: both;"/>

	<div class="readme_entry">
		<div class="readme_body">
			<div class="readme_subject">
				<h1>The Weapons</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>PUNCHY</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/punchy.jpg" alt="">
				This puppet is really dangerous for your opponents. It's bite causes high damage! This weapon is the right
				choice for close combat,
				or when you want to escape a senseless fight, because while using the Punchy you can run a bit faster than
				with the other weapons-
				good to get away, or get closer to your enemies. If you make 5 frags with punchy in one round, you'll become a
				Puppet Master (see Power-ups).<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>NiPPER</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/nipper.jpg" alt="">
				The NiPPER is the starting weapon and works in the same way as a pistol. This weapon has an auto-fire like
				every other weapon, but if you click your mouse button really fast, it will shoot faster than the normal
				auto-fire.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>PUMPER</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/pumper.jpg" alt="">
				The PUMPER is like a shotgun. Having flashes at the end of the trail, it lets you hurt people near the trail.
				This weapon has a limited firing range.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>BUBBLE G.</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/bubbleg.jpg" alt="">
				It's gettin' colorful. The BUBBLE G. (Bubble Gum) shoots small little colored balls very fast. These might
				make you go crazy ;).<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>BALLOONY</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/balloony.jpg" alt="">
				This is a fun weapon. It shoots cool water bombs, which jump around in the arena. It's not easy to make an
				aimed shot,
				but if you hit the opponent, he'll take a lot of damage. The perfect weapon to shoot into a
				crowd!<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>SPLASHER</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/splasher.jpg" alt="">
				Every game needs a sniper rifle. In the World of Padman, the SPLASHER is the weapon for all the campers out
				there. With its variable zoom,
				it is the perfect weapon for long and mid-range distances. Disadvantage: it needs some time to
				reload.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>BOASTER</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/boaster.jpg" alt="">
				This is a really strange weapon. Its jet, curved like a water jet, causes a lot of damage. Besides the damage,
				the jet will make the floor very slippery.
				It is not easy to move on this floor, so you will be an easy target if you walk on it.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>BOOM-BOOM BETTY</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/betty.jpg" alt="">
				The BETTY shoots really huge fire balls. Important: the fire balls do not
				fly very fast but they do cause splash damage over a large area. It's really good for mid-ranged
				distances.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>iMPERiUS</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/imperius.jpg" alt="">
				If you see a pink star, then RUN! With its all-destroying explosion, the iMPERiUS is the most powerful weapon
				ever.
				But this gun has two big disadvantages. The maximum ammo limit is set at two shots, and you have to hold down
				the fire key for a few seconds
				until the weapon is ready to shoot. But do not hold it down too long or the weapon will explode in your hands.
				Oh, and it shakes while loading, so it's not very easy to aim.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>iNJECTOR</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/weapons/injector.jpg" alt="">
				A very special weapon, so special, that you will not see it lying around in the maps. The iNJECTOR is only
				available in the "InstaPad" game mode, but here it is the only weapon. The
				characteristic of this gun is basically the same as the SPLASHER ones, so it has a low fire rate, but causes
				very high damage. The Zoom of the iNJECTOR is an advanced one, because enemys are
				shown glowing, making them easy to track.<br style="clear: both;"/>

				<h1>The HUD</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Changeable HUDs</h2>
				We created 10 different HUD designs for you to choose from. Just select the one you want and the change will
				be applied immediately.
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Left</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" src="pictures/hud/lefthud.jpg" alt="">
				The left part of the HUD shows your selected weapon and the ammo for it. The scores of the teams are also
				shown here
				so you can see see which team is currently winning. The yellow circle containing the X shows which team is
				yours.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Center</h2>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/hud/centerhud.jpg" alt="">
				This is the most important part of the HUD. Here you can see your health and shield status.
				The left part (red) is for health, and when it's completely filled, you have 100% health.
				You can have more than 100% health with revival or after respawn. Having part of the bar a darker red shows
				this.
				The blue side (shield) on the right works in the same way. If you have more than 100% shield, the part over
				100% is shown on the bar as dark blue.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Right</h2>
				The design of this part depends on the game mode you are playing. In normal FFA, TDM and "Last Pad Standing",
				the right part is empty.
				Playing "Spray your Color", "Big Balloon" or "Capture the Lolly", you'll find some helpful information here.
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/hud/righthudsyc.jpg" alt="">
				<h3>Spray your Color</h3>
				The amount of collected cartridges is displayed here. Having a limit of eight collected
				cartridges,
				you'll notice that eight small dots are here. Every red dot means one collected cartridge.
				<h3>Big Balloon</h3>
				Shows which team dominates which balloons. After a few rounds, you'll know where to find the
				each balloon.
				A small bar shows how much longer you have to be near a balloon to activate it.
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:right; margin: 10px 0 0 10px;" src="pictures/hud/righthudbb.jpg" alt="">
				<h3>Capture the Lolly</h3>
				In this gametype you'll see the status of the Lollies here. There are three different
				states: the lolly is safe in your base, it is taken by an enemy, or
				the status is unknown, meaning that the Lolly is dropped somewhere in the map.<br style="clear: both;"/>

			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Health & Shield</h2>
				<h3>Loading Station</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/misc/health.jpg" alt="">
				In the "World of Padman" there are no health bubbles to collect. Instead of picking health up, you have to
				step on a "Heath Station".
				As long as you stand on a loading station you'll regenerate your health. Naturally, you'll not get more than
				100% health.
				If you reach the 100% a voice will let you know that you are fully regenerated. Also, the stations do not have
				unlimited health to give.
				The size of the cross shows you how much health is left at a station. If a station is empty, it will
				regenerate itself, this will take one minute,
				then it is ready to use again.<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>PadShield</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/shield.jpg" alt="">
				Collect this item and you'll instantly get 100% shield!<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>PadShard</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/shard.jpg" alt="">
				Collect a PadShard and you'll receive 5 shield points. The nice thing about the shards is, that you'll get 5
				points even if you already have 100% shield!<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Powerups</h2>
				<h3>PADPOWER</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/padpower.jpg" alt="">
				This gives a mixture of power and protection. Picking up this power-up means that you need to hurry up with
				your fragging.
				You will do more than 2 times the normal damage and you will also protected by damage from your opponents! And
				as an extra, you own weapons don't hurt you either (try jumps with the Imperius
				or Betty).<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>REViVAL</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/revival.jpg" alt="">
				You'll not be completely invincible, but your health will regenerate automatically. With this item you'll get up
				to 200% health.<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>JUMPER</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/jumper.jpg" alt="">
				Jump around. This power-up lets you jump three times higher than normal. You can reach parts of the maps that
				you would not normally see.
				Jumping around also makes you a target that is hard to hit, although watch out for those pesky snipers.
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>ViSiONLESS</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/visionless.jpg" alt="">
				It's cool to hunt people down while being invisible, but you are not 100% invisible. A slightly visual effect
				can be seen of you look carefully, but most of the time you'll be able to reach
				the teleporter or steal the lolly without being seen and attacked by the opponents.<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>SPEEDY</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/speedy.jpg" alt="">
				Hey, how fast can you get?! The Speedy power-up will increase your speed a lot and that's not only good to
				hunt your opponents with the Punchy, it also helps you escape.<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>PuppetMaster</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/puppetmaster.jpg" alt="">
				After 5 frags with Punchy you will become the Puppet Master of World of Padman for 30 seconds.
				You'll be faster and stronger than your opponents, and the Punchy will cause even more damage. Hunt your
				enemies and bite them! DO NOT USE IN COMBINATION WITH PADPOWER AND SPEEDY!
				<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Holdables</h2>
				<h3>FLOATER</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/floater.jpg" alt="">
				The FLOATER lets you fly. The cool thing is that you decide when you want to fly and how long you want to do so.
				After you have picked up this item you'll get a new display on the right, showing how much "fuel" is still left.
				Pressing the "USE" key will give you a boost up into the air.<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>KiLLERDUCKS</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/killerducks.jpg" alt="">
				You can let these bad beasts loose on your opponents. As soon as you are close to them, you can send out a
				duck by pressing the "USE" key.
				The ducks will now automatically search for an opponent that is near them, and will attack and follow him. But
				if there is no opponent, the ducks could attack you!<br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>BOOMiES</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/boomies.jpg" alt="">
				"Small, but powerful", that's how these mines are described best. Whenever the player picks up the item, three
				limpet mines that can be placed around the map are added to the player's
				inventory. You won't be able to create whole mine fields with that, but the mines work very well as a
				defensive weapon. After having been placed by the "USE" button, they explode when
				approached and deal massive damage. Because of their dangerousness there are locations on the map where the
				mines must not be placed.<br>
				<i>This power-up is only available in the modes "Capture the Lolly" and
					"BigBalloon".</i><br style="clear: both;"/>
				<h3>BAMBAM</h3>
				<img class="readme_image" style="float:left;" src="pictures/powerups/bambam.jpg" alt="">
				The BAMBAM is a turret that automatically shoots any target in sight. It can be disabled by sufficient fire
				power though. Because the BAMBAM is a mighty weapon, it must not be placed on
				certain areas on the map as well as in hard to reach places. The BAMBAM is set up with the "USE" button.<br>
				<i>This power-up is only available in the mode "Capture the Lolly".</i><br style="clear: both;"/>

				<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>

			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Bot Support</h2>
				World of Padman features full bot support for all game types! All you offline gamers out there will be
				happy to play Spray your Color,
				Big Balloon, Last Pad Standing and Capture the Lolly with bots. The bots play very well, and most maps have
				been optimized for good bot play.
				It is pure fun to see the blue nosed people frag each other in SyC and BB.
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Drop Cardriges / Drop Lolly</h2>
				This features only works in Team SyC and Capture the Lolly! You have collected some cartridges, but your
				health is running out and you'll not reach the teleporter in time?
				You can to give a team mate some of your cartridges so that the teammate can get some extra points for the
				team with a spray killer (5) or spray god (8) medal. In Capture the Lolly you'll be
				able to throw the lolly to other players.
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Voice Chat</h2>
				In the past you had to use the keyboard to communicate with other players, but these days are gone, because
				World of Padman features voice chat. This has to be activated in the menu
				at Setup -> System -> Sound. After activating it, you also have the choice between automatic speech detection
				and "push-to-talk" - like from old walkie-talkies. If you choose
				"push-to-talk", you can bind a key to this fuction in the Controls -> Misc menu.<br>
				Within a match, you can adjust the volume of the players or mute single players via an ingame menu.

				<h2>GlowSkins</h2>
				For serious tournaments it is important that you can recognize other players as enemies very fast. That's why
				you can activate so called GlowSkins in the menu ("Setup -> Game Options") in
				World of Padman. If you have turned them on, the models of the enemys will get a shiny green skin, which makes
				them stick them out of the surrounding environment. Especially for clans and
				fast-paced 1on1's is this option a blessing in disguise. For the game design, it is not. ;)

				<h2>The Server HUD</h2>
				<img style="float:left;" class="readme_image" alt="" src="pictures/misc/server_hud_kl.jpg">
				Server info can be displayed in a small window you can toggle using a key of your choice (default=k). It will
				show you things like the point limit, time limit, etc.<br style="clear: both;"/>
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Warmup</h2>
				The command g_WarmupReady can be used to delay the starting of the game before a certain percentage of players
				are ready.
				The server admin can set g_WarmupReady to a value between 0 and 1 (first set "g_doWarmup 1"!) - 0 means no one
				has to type in /ready and
				the game starts immediately and 1 means that 100% of the players have to type it in. With this method, 0.6
				means 60 percent have to type in /ready and so on.<br><br>
				This command is especially useful for LPS games, just after a map change. The other players can wait until the
				rest have successfully joined the server.
				For team play it is cool too, if you do not want to just have fun, but have a serious game (clan war or
				something like this).
				<h3>examples</h3>
				set g_doWarmup "1"<br>
				set g_WarmupReady "0.5" // 50 % have to be /ready
				<br><br>
				or
				<br><br>
				set g_doWarmup "1"
				set g_WarmupReady "0.8" // 80 % have to be /ready
			</div>
			<div class="readme_inner">
				<h2>Chat Icons</h2>
				Everything is colorful, even the chat! The chat logos are colorful and show off a small pic of the model the
				chatter uses, making it easier to identify
				the chatters. You'll see there are four different chat methods: "only text" (normal and long) is a normal chat
				style and "+icons" (normal and long)
				is for the chat with the new icons. Normal and long stands for the time the chat text is displayed.

				<h2>Bugs</h2>
				The game has been in development for years, but this does not mean that it is bug-free. Like every publisher
				and developer we have added some bugs to the game, so that you have something to look at.
				If you find one of these bugs then please E-Mail us and we'll work on a fix.
